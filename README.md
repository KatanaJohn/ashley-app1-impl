# How to Use the ToDoList Application

**Add Item:** To add an item to the to do list, click add item. You must type in something into the description box that ranges from 1-256 characters for it to add an item. A due date is not required and will be displayed as N/A if no date is added. If you have the "Task Complete" box checked when adding an item, the completion for that item will be shown as "true". Otherwise, it will be shown as "false".

**Edit Item:** To edit an item, first click a row you would like to edit. Then go back up to the input fields and enter the new description, or due date you'd like to add. Then click the edit button. This **also allows you to mark something as complete, or incomplete.**

**Remove Item:** To remove an item, click on one of the item rows and press the "Delete Item" button.  This will remove the selected item from the list.

**Clear List:** To delete everything from the list, click the delete all button. This will allow you to clear the list and restart. 

**Filter List:** If you would like to filter the list to only see complete, incomplete, or all items, click on "view" and select what type of items you would like to display.

**Save List:** To save a list, click "file" then "save list". This will bring up a file explorer and allow you to choose a location and name for the text file you'd like to complete. After choosing the location and name, click save in the file explorer to save the file. If you would like to back out, click cancel.

**Load List:** To load a list from a file, click the "file" button and select "Open List". This will bring the file explorer back up again and allow you to choose a file you would like to load. Once you choose a file and click open, it will load the chosen file into the to do list. If the file doesn't load, that means that it's either not a .txt file, or not in the correct format.
